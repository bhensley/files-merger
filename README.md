# Files Merger
Takes two directories and merges all files within to a third directory. Developed initially to solve a simple
"problem" I had, where each month I would constantly find myself combining a baseline set of wallpapers for my desktop 
to rotate between, and a monthly set of temporary to mix into it.

Currently the design of this application is to copy all files across two directories, rename them to idenfiy where they 
came from, saving them into a third directory.
